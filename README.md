# Introduction
This repository is aimied at storing the documentation of personal financial engineering projects created by Cody McCrystal, a recent MSc Finance graduate who has a great personal interest in focusing on the quantitative side, aspiring to enter the financial engineering industry to become a quant. The projects contained herein are aimed at demonstrating my skills and expertise in financial engineering.

# Background
As a graduate of a Masters in Finance program, I have developed a strong foundation of finance skills - both qualitative and quantiative. From interests in financial analysis to portfolio optimisation, my interest has found itself in many areas of general finance. However, since writing my MSc thesis titles "Hedge Fund Portfolio Optimisation using a Vine-Copula-GARCH-EVT-CVaR Model", my interests have focused towards honing my quantiative skills - which meant revisiting concepts I had seen in finance, aiming to understand the mathematical side of them whilst also keeping significant grounding in the application side. 

I am now seeking to enter a long-term career in the financial engineering industry. I have identified three main parent categories which I need to become an expert in to truly exceed within, and maximise the value I am able to contribute in such career. These are;

- Mathematics
- Finance
- Programming

As such, I wish to develop all these skills together by implementing coding projects which aim to implement the models which I learn in my personal time.
